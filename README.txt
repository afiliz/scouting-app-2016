AMHS Robotics Scouting App 2016

This was a web application I built with my colleagues in our high school's FIRST robotics team, 
Archibishop Mitty Robotics (team #1351).

During previous robotics competitions our team was in, we would have paper forms for team members watching matches to 
keep track of other teams' robots' performances. While we were able to get a general sense of how other teams' robots were doing
from these paper forms, it was difficult to gain valuable conclusions from the hundreds of forms that were completed.

I was the co-lead of our team's website division, and worked with 3 other peers to solve this issue. We decided since all of our
team's members had access to iPads, we decided that we could build a digital form that would help us manage the enourmous amounts
of data we got from competitions.

I was in charge of building the scouting app's interface and working on any front end-related problems. I designed the app to perfectly fit
on a first generation iPad Air's screen so that it would be easy for users to access the whole form at once. You can find my work on the
app in the webbapp folder in /src/main/webapp, where I used HTML and CSS to build the interface.

In the end, our app was a success. Our app was deployed to 6 iPads per match (1 form for every robot in the match), which would send
data to a Bluetooth server on a nearby Rasberry Pi, which would create a pdf of all the data in a readable format. Our app was
praised by judges at competitions we went to as well.
